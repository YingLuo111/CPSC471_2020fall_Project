After python3 is installed, navigate to the src folder and then run the following
First run the FTP server by doing the following:
    $ python3 serv.py <Port Number>

    E.g. 
    $ python3 serv.py 5000


Second run the FTP client by doing the following:

    $ python3 cli.py <Server Machine> <Server Port Number>

    E.g.
    $ python3 cli.py localhost 5000

Note: the port number should be the same for both the server and client.
